Let's think step-by-step:

1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas
2. Food names should go in singular when filtering
3. All strings in the filters should be in uppercase
4. Every filter should be using `str.contains()`
5. The final line of code should be a Python expression that can be called with the `eval()` function.
6. The code should represent a solution to the query.
7. PRINT ONLY THE EXPRESSION.
8. Do not quote the expression.
